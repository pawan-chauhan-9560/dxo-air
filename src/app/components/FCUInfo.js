        A Fan Coil Unit (FCU) is a vital component in heating, ventilation, and
        air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It uses a fan to circulate air over a
        coil containing either hot or cold water, conditioning the air in the
        surrounding space. FCUs are often used in individual rooms or zones to
        maintain a comfortable temperature, offering flexibility and energy
        efficiency.
